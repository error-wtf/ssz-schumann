# SSZ Detection Null Test Report

**Generated:** 2025-12-08T10:37:11.685008

## Test Statistic Definition

The SSZ test statistic T_SSZ is defined as:

```
T_SSZ = w_corr * r_mean + w_scatter * (1 - scatter_ratio)
```

where:
- `r_mean` = mean pairwise correlation between delta_seg from different modes
- `scatter_ratio` = std(between modes) / mean(within mode std)
- `w_corr = 0.7`, `w_scatter = 0.3` (default weights)

Higher T_SSZ indicates stronger SSZ signature.

## Null Hypothesis

H0: No SSZ signal present (delta_seg variations are independent noise)

The null distribution is generated by shuffling time indices independently per mode,
which destroys any true temporal correlation while preserving marginal distributions.

## Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| T_SSZ (observed) | 0.7797 |
| P-value | 0.0099 |
| Significant (α=0.05) | True |
| Mean mode correlation | 0.8174 |
| Scatter ratio | 0.3083 |

## Interpretation

**SSZ signature detected** at the 95% confidence level.

The observed T_SSZ of 0.7797 exceeds 
the critical value from the null distribution (p = 0.0099).
